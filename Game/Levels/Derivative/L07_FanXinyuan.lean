  Hint "This level is definitely within your reach! Just think back to the similar challenges you've already conquered—those same techniques will help you here. You've got this!"
  Hint "First thing first, Looking at this long string of 'additions', don't you just want to break it apart? That's exactly right! Let's split it into smaller pieces - this will make our work so much easier!"

  Hint "Take a closer look at our 'Goal' - numbers and variables scattered everywhere...
it's quite a mess, isn't it? There's a magical tactic that can clean and 'simplify' this up for us - can you guess what it is?"
  simp --this tactic was introduced
  Hint "Now show all the differentiability conditions required by previous proof steps."

  Hint "When using compound differentiability lemmas like 'const_mul', take note how to spell the lemma, some letters needs capitalisation."
