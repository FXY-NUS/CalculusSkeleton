Statement (x : ℝ) : deriv (fun x => Real.sin ( Real.sin ( Real.sin x ) ) ) (x : ℝ) =
 Real.cos x * Real.cos ( Real.sin x ) * Real.cos ( Real.sin ( Real.sin x ) ) := by
 Hint "This is an application of 'Composite Function Derivative', firstly you need to let lean figure out what is the composite function which means you need to set sin(sinx) as function g, which means that we need to turn the goal into : derivative of sin(sin(sin x)) = derivative of sin ∘ g  "
 Hint "To make the sin(sin x) into the function g, you need to try tactic: set g := fun x => ..."
 Hint "Remind that sin in lean should be typed as Real.sin"
 set g := fun x => Real.sin ( Real.sin x )
 Hint "To prove sin(sin(sin x)) = sin ∘ g, use the have and fun x tactic : have : (fun x => Real.sin (Real.sin (Real.sin x))) = Real.sin ∘ g"
 Hint "Notice that there is a tap between two sin : Real.sin ( Real.sin ( Real.sin x ) ))"
 have : (fun x => Real.sin ( Real.sin ( Real.sin x ) )) = Real.sin ∘ g := rfl
 Hint "Now the goal turn into proving: deriv (Real.sin ∘ g) x = Real.cos x * Real.cos (Real.sin x) * Real.cos (Real.sin (Real.sin x))"
 Hint "Rewrite the assumption"
 rw[this]
 Hint "Now to prove : deriv (Real.sin ∘ g) = deriv (g) * deriv (Real.sin (g)), use the deriv.comp tactic"
 rw[deriv.comp]
 Hint "Now the goal are : Proving sin'(x)=cos'(x) and proving g'= cos(x)*cos(sin(x)); Use the Real.deriv_sin tactic"
 rw[Real.deriv_sin]
 Hint "To prove g'= cos(x)*cos(sin(x)), the logic of proving is the same and now suppose we already have the tactic 'deriv_sinsinx'"
 rw[deriv_sinsinx]
 Hint "The remaining problem is just use commutativity of multiplication"
 rw[mul_comm]
 Hint "Now the left two goal is to prove functions sinx and sin(sinx) are differentiable, and you can use the tactic 'Real.differentiableAt_sin' and 'sinsinx_differentiable x' "
